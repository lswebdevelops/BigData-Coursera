1.Check all true statements about the Directed Acyclic Graph 
skipped

A DAG is used...

2. Why is building a DAG necessary in Spark but not in MapReduce?
Because MapReduce always has the same type of workflow, Spark needs to accommodate diverse workflows.

3. What are the differences between an action and a transformation? Mark all that apply
A transformation is from worker nodes to worker nodes, an action between worker nodes and the Driver (or a data source like HDFS)
A transformation is lazy, an action instead executes immediately.

4.Generally, which are good stages to mark a RDD for caching in memory?
After data cleaning, parsing and validation.
At the start of an iterative algorithm.


5.What are good cases for using a broadcast variable? Mark all that apply
Copy a large configuration dictionary to all worker nodes
Copy a large lookup table to all worker nodes
Copy a small/medium sized RDD for a join

6.
def count_invalid(element):
    try:
        int(element)
    except:
        invalid.add(1)

1 and 4 wrong
